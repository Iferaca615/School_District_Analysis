# School_District_Analysis
written in python using anaconda and jupyter
# Overview and Purpose
Maria is the chief data scientist for a city school district and she is tasked with analyzing data in different formats and uncovering trends in the data set.  The trends and insights found uncovered in the data set will help make decisions about test score trends and performance at different schools, as well as budgeting information.

## Purpose
In this challenge we wanted to:
1) see how the dishonesty altered overall district data
2) replace Thomas High School data with NaN, while keeping rest of data intact
3) re-perform the analysis in the module
4) compare results of two analysis's
